# Obey the Testing Goat
I'm reading [Test-Driven Development with Python](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com). It's because I want to get the grasp of actually doing testing well.
What kind of tests I actually need to write, what kind of intuitive criteria, the experience, and what kind of functions I need to test.
Also, how to architect test code, well it's obvious since it'll be mostly the same with coding real code. But still!
From now, I'll be writing tests in a smart manner and keep on dedicating all my time on making my software testable, safe, and descriptive.
